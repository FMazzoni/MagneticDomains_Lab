# Magnetic Domains Lab (2019 Advanced Physics Lab)

The following repository shows the image analysis process for the Magnetic Domains Lab.

Like all other labs in the class, we were given one week to research and understand the experiment, another week to perform and collect the data from the expirement and one last week to write a report on the process and results. 

This class and the Magnetic Domains lab specifically was my first introduction to image analysis using python.

Please feel free to check out the Magnetic Domain Lab Report for full discussion on details and specifics on the analysis between "hard" and "soft" magnetization.

Here's the abstract:

Magnetic materials have shown to be useful in the storage of computer data. Bell Labs developed
a type of material known as ferrimagnetic garnets (FMG). This material allows for direct observation
of magnetic domains. Using polarizing microscopy a pattern of “light” and “dark” areas will form.
These areas are the magnetic domains of FMG. The lab will attempt to characterize the magnetic
properties of FMG by analyzing the magnetic domains and quantifying the magnetization of the
sample.

A little bit of "art" made during the analysis:
